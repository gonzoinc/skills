## Collection policy

Activate this skill only after the user explicitly requests it or accepts a recommendation. Recommendations are allowed; wait for acceptance before activating **any supporting skill**, including from a handoff, note or another skill. Reading a candidate for comparison does not authorize executing it. Skill references below are recommendations, never automatic calls. The user-authorized exception is `post-mortem`: it may automatically record unexpected failures and consult recovery history without activating another workflow.

Follow applicable user and project rules, existing documentation and artifact locations, and the canonical project workspace. Do not create parallel guidance or silently replace existing skills. Use the project's established context sources and normal filesystem tools. Delegate only when authorized and useful.

Put all agent working files in the active project or working folder's primary `.codex/` directory. Remove your temporary scripts, dependencies, captures, logs and intermediates when no longer needed, before reporting completion. Only intended deliverables and maintained project source belong elsewhere. Preserve user-owned and unrelated files; explain any working material retained for unfinished work or reproducibility.

Use short slash names in user-facing recommendations and usage examples, such as `/diagnose-bugs` or `/grilling`; do not require users to type a `gonzo-skills:` prefix. In the desktop app these select skills through the slash menu. Mention the collection name only when needed to distinguish duplicate entries. User acceptance still gates each supporting workflow.

When gathering user input, ask one concise question, optionally give a recommendation, and wait for the answer before asking the next. Do not hide several independent questions inside one sentence or form. Reuse settled answers. This governs the live interview; a requested questionnaire or specification may contain multiple questions or requirements as its deliverable.

Keep secrets out of commands shown to the user and saved artifacts. Use research and browser tools permitted by the active project and user. External publishing and production changes require the applicable user authorization and a concrete reviewable result first. Do not infer that acceptance of this workflow authorizes unrelated writes.

For any user-assisted action, first explain the single action needed, ask whether the user is ready, and stop. Only after explicit readiness request the action and begin dependent capture, monitoring or interactive work. Then stop and wait for completion or the actual result; silence and elapsed time are not completion. Allow adequate time without an arbitrary short timeout.

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec. Do NOT interview the user; just synthesize what you already know.

Use existing tracker and documentation conventions. If context is insufficient, recommend `setup-collection` and wait for acceptance; do not activate it automatically. Draft locally first when external publication is not yet authorized. No label setup or excluded workflow is required.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the spec, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the spec using the template below, then publish it to the project issue tracker. Use the project's existing status convention if applicable; do not create labels or require another workflow. Publish externally only within the user's authorization after the concrete draft is reviewable.

<spec-template>

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts, not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this spec.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
